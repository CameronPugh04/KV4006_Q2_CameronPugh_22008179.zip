My project was to design a hotel booking app which is compatible to mobile. I successfully created 6 working pages, this includes the home page, about us page, search results page, booking page, confirm booking page and an enter details page.

To get back to the home page when you are on another page, simply press the "Home" button located at the top of the page.

To get to the about us page, press the "About us" button located at the top of the page.

To search for a hotel, enter the details into the search bar then press the search icon.

After pressing the search icon you will find a list of hotels, to book one of these hotels press the "more" button and you will be brought to the booking page. From here you will select Bed and Breakfast or All Inclusive. Press on the button located on the right side of the page in line with the package you want to select.

You are now at the Confirm Booking page. Here you will need to enter your details and when complete you will be shown a price. Press continue for more details.

You now need to enter your email address and phone number so the company can contact you.

This app is compatible with mobile phones.

All text within the app will need to be altered by clients as this is the text I was provided with.
